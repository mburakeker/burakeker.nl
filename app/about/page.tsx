            Hey, I&apos;m Burak Eker! I&apos;ve been working as a Full-Stack
            Developer for 6 years, building web apps. I started messing around
            with computers when I was just 9 years old, mainly for gaming and
            later diving into programming. Over the years, I&apos;ve worked in
            industries like finance, e-commerce, and manufacturing, tackling
            challenges and building solutions that truly make a difference.
          </p>

            My skill set covers both backend and frontend development, with a
            strong focus on .NET, React, Angular, and Azure.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Outside of work, I enjoy reading tech news, trying out new indie
            games, discovering{" "}
